        <p><strong>Lionel Andrés Messi</strong> [note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born
            24 June 1987), also known as <strong>Leo Messi</strong> , is an <strong>Argentine</strong> professional
            footballer who plays as a forward and captains the <strong>Argentina</strong> national team. Widely regarded
            as one of the greatest players of all time, <strong>Messi</strong> has won a record seven Ballon d'Or
            awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream
            Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he
            won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA
            Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World
            Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474),
            most hat-tricks in <strong>La Liga</strong> (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in
            La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male
            (103).<strong>Messi</strong> has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most
            goals by a player for a single club (672). <br><br>

            Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut
            aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three
            years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in
            Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed,
            with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times.
            During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season,
            while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished
            second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best
            form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a
            historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of
            Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club
            Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. Following
            the 2023 season, Messi announced that he would be joining Inter Miami CF of Major League Soccer in July
            2023.[10] <br><br>

            An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national
            record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the
            tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics.
            His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona,
            who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest
            Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América,
            where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina
            to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa
            América, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement
            in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a
            third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden
            Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. For this achievement, Messi received a record-extending seventh Ballon
            d'Or in 2021. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden
            Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World
            Cup (26). <br><br>

            Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's
            highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's
            highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the
            world in 2011, 2012 and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, with
            Messi being the first team-sport athlete to win the award. In 2020, Messi became the second footballer and
            second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.</p>
        <li><strong id="ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>
            <div class="ron"></div>
        </li>
        <p><strong> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM </strong>(Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu
            ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and
            captains both Saudi Professional League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one
            of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European
            Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league
            titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo
            holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in
            the European Championship (14), international goals (123) and international appearances (200). He is one of
            the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 800 official
            senior career goals for club and country, making him the highest goalscorer of all time. <br><br>

            Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the
            FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the
            Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the
            subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a
            transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with
            Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions League wins from 2014 to
            2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again
            in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also
            became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished
            as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won
            four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World
            Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most
            expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two
            Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and
            became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned
            to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract
            was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr. <br><br>

            Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned 200 caps,
            making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the
            all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first
            international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the
            national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the
            Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at
            Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement
            would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations
            League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top
            scorer of Euro 2020. <br><br>

            One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete
            by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him
            on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the
            third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.</p>
        <li><strong id="ronaldinho">Ronaldinho</strong>
            <div class="ronal"></div>
        </li>
        <p><strong>Ronaldo de Assis Moreira</strong> (born 21 March 1980), commonly known as <strong>Ronaldinho
                Gaúcho</strong> (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʁonawˈdʒĩɲu ɡaˈuʃu]) or simply <strong>Ronaldinho</strong>
            ,[note 1] is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played mostly as an attacking midfielder, but
            was also deployed as a winger. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he won two FIFA
            World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. He is the only player ever to have won a World Cup, a
            Copa América, a Confederations Cup, a Champions League, a Copa Libertadores and a Ballon d'Or.[4] A global
            icon of the sport, Ronaldinho was renowned for his technical skills, creativity, dribbling ability and
            accuracy from free-kicks, his use of tricks, feints, no-look passes and overhead kicks, as well as his
            ability to score and create goals, all prominent characteristics of his early-age background playing futsal.
            He is known by the nickname "O Bruxo" ("The Wizard").[5][6] <br><br>

            Ronaldinho made his career debut for Grêmio, in 1998. At age 20, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in France
            before signing for Barcelona in 2003. In his second season with Barcelona, he won his first FIFA World
            Player of the Year award as Barcelona won the 2004–05 La Liga title. The season that followed is considered
            one of the best in his career as he was integral in Barcelona winning the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League,
            their first in fourteen years, and another La Liga title, giving Ronaldinho his first career double,
            receiving the 2005 Ballon d'Or and his second FIFA World Player of the Year in the process. After scoring
            two spectacular solo goals in the first 2005–06 El Clásico, Ronaldinho became the second Barcelona player,
            after Diego Maradona in 1983, to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu.
            <br><br>

            Following a second-place La Liga finish to Real Madrid in the 2006–07 season and an injury-plagued 2007–08
            season, Ronaldinho suffered a decline in his performances—often put down to a decrease in dedication and
            focus having achieved so much in the sport—and departed Barcelona to join AC Milan, where he won the 2010–11
            Serie A. He returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atlético Mineiro a year later where he won
            the 2013 Copa Libertadores, before moving to Mexico to play for Querétaro and then back to Brazil to play
            for Fluminense in 2015. Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual awards in his career: he was
            included in the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times each, and was named UEFA Club
            Footballer of the Year for the 2005–06 season and South American Footballer of the Year in 2013; in 2004, he
            was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. <br><br>

            In his international career with Brazil, Ronaldinho earned 97 caps and scored 33 goals and represented his
            country in two FIFA World Cups. After debuting with the Seleção by winning the 1999 Copa América, he was an
            integral part of the 2002 FIFA World Cup-winning team, starring alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo in an
            attacking trio, and was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. As captain, he led his team to the 2005
            FIFA Confederations Cup title and was named man of the match in the final. He also captained the Brazil
            Olympic team to a bronze medal in men's football at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

            <div class="car"></div>
        </li>
        <p><strong>Roberto Carlos da Silva Rocha</strong> (born 10 April 1973), often known as <strong>Roberto
                Carlos</strong> and sometimes as <strong>RC3</strong> [note
            1] is a Brazilian former professional footballer who currently works as a football ambassador.[4] He started
            his career in Brazil as a forward but spent most of his career as a left-back and has been described as the
            "most offensive-minded left-back in the history of the game".[5] A free kick specialist throughout his
            career, his bending shots have measured at over 105 miles per hour (169 km/h).[6][7] In 1997, he was
            runner-up in the FIFA World Player of the Year. Widely considered one of the greatest full-backs and
            left-backs in history, in 2004 he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living
            players.[8][9][10] <br><br>

            At club level, Roberto Carlos joined Real Madrid from Inter Milan in 1996 to spend 11 highly successful
            seasons, playing 584 matches in all competitions and scoring 71 goals. At Real, he won four La Liga titles
            and the UEFA Champions League three times. In April 2013, Marca named him in their "Best Foreign Eleven in
            Real Madrid's History".[11] He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career
            appearances at club and international level. <br><br>

            Roberto Carlos made his debut for the Brazil national team in 1992. He played in three World Cups, helping
            the team reach the final in 1998 in France, and win the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. He was
            named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team in 1998 and 2002. With Brazil he is especially known for a bending
            40-yard free kick against France in the inaugural match of Tournoi de France 1997. With 125 caps he has made
            the third-most appearances for his national team.[12] He was chosen on the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in a
            2002 FIFA poll. <br><br>

            He took up management and was named as the manager of Sivasspor in the Turkish Süper Lig in June 2013.[13]
            He resigned as head coach in December 2014.[14] From January to June 2015, he was manager of Akhisarspor.
            Although Roberto Carlos announced his retirement from playing at the age of 39 in 2012,[15] in July 2015 he
            was appointed player/manager of Indian Super League club Delhi Dynamos, with whom he would make three
            appearances.[16]</p>
        <li><strong id="benzema">Karim Benzema</strong>
            <div class="ben"></div>
        </li>
        <p><strong>Karim Mostafa Benzema</strong> (born 19 December 1987) is a French professional footballer who plays
            as a striker for Saudi Professional League club Al-Ittihad. Regarded as one of the best strikers of all
            time, he is a creative forward renowned for his goal-scoring ability, as well as his technical skills,
            vision, and versatility on the field.[4][5][6] He is Real Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and
            top assist provider.[7] Benzema won 24 trophies with Real Madrid, including four La Liga, three Copa del
            Rey, and five UEFA Champions League titles. <br><br>

            Born in Lyon to Algerian parents, Benzema began his career with hometown club Olympique Lyonnais in 2005,
            contributing sporadically to three Ligue 1 title wins. In 2008, he was named the league's Player of the Year
            and in the Team of the Year having finished as the league's top goalscorer and winning his fourth league
            title and first Coupe de France. In 2009, Benzema was the subject of a then-French record football transfer
            when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €35 million. After struggling to establish himself in his debut
            season, he eventually achieved a consistent goalscoring rate with the club, notably being part of a highly
            rated trio alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale — dubbed BBC — who were integral to four Champions
            League wins from 2014 to 2018. <br><br>

            Following Ronaldo's departure in 2018, Benzema transitioned from the false 9 position into a sole striker.
            He was named in the La Liga Team of the Season for four consecutive years from 2018 to 2022, won La Liga
            Best Player twice and the Pichichi Trophy for the first time in 2022. Benzema finished as Champions League
            top scorer as he won his fifth title in 2022, and subsequently captained the club in his final season before
            signing for Al-Ittihad the following year. <br><br>

            A French international, Benzema won the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and made his senior debut
            for France in 2007, at age 19. He earned 97 caps, including scoring in three and appearing in four major
            tournaments, and ranks as France's sixth-highest all-time top goalscorer. Benzema was controversially left
            out of the squad for the 2010 World Cup and did not play for France for over five years after being
            implicated in a blackmailing scandal in 2015; he later returned to the squad before announcing his
            international retirement in December 2022. He has been named French Player of the Year by France Football
            four times. For his performances in 2021 and 2022, Benzema was awarded the UEFA Player of the Year and the
            Ballon d'Or, becoming the fifth French player to have won the Ballon d'Or.[8] At 34 years and 302 days old,
            he is the second-oldest winner of the award, after Stanley Matthews.[9]</p>
        <li><strong id="neymar">Neymar Junior</strong>
            <div class="ney"></div>
        </li>
        <p><strong> Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior</strong> (born 5 February 1992), known as <strong>Neymar Júnior</strong>  or mononymously as <strong>Neymar</strong> , is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. A prolific goalscorer and renowned playmaker, he is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world as well as one of the greatest Brazilian footballers of all time.[3][4][5] Neymar has scored at least 100 goals for three different clubs, making him one of four players to achieve this feat.[6] <br><br>

            Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, dubbed MSN, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. He then attained a domestic double in the 2015–16 season. Motivated to be a talisman at club level, Neymar transferred to PSG in 2017[7] in a move worth €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever.[note 1] In France, he won five league titles, among other honours, and was voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year in his debut season.[10] Notably, he helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, and led the club to its first ever Champions League final. <br><br>
            
            Debuting for Brazil aged 18, Neymar is currently joint-top goalscorer for his national team alongside Pelé, with 77 goals in 124 matches including friendlies, and 31 goals in all competitive games. At his youth stage for Brazil, he was a key player in the victory at the 2011 South American Youth Championship, where he finished as leading goalscorer, and also attained a silver medal in men's football at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The following year, he won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning the Golden Ball. His participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa América was cut short by injury and a suspension, respectively, before captaining Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Having renounced the captaincy, he featured at the 2018 World Cup, and after missing the 2019 Copa América through injury, helped Brazil to a runner-up finish at the 2021 tournament. <br><br>
